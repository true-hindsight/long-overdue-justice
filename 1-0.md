# Mass Murders of Civilians and Allied Soldiers By US-led Groups

<div align="center">

  <h2><ins>Part I</ins></h2>

</div>

This documentation provides details on how civilians, and also allied soldiers of the US, were killed en mass, by various US-led groups due to misuse and abuse of drone based technologies. The word "drones" generally refers to unmanned, autonomous platforms operational on land, in air, at sea, and in outer space. However, here drones and drone based technologies as systems, mainly allude to aerial platforms or vehicles, equipped for reconnaissance and/or combat. 

In particular, the details showcased here, explain the roles of various persons involved in aviation related defense **research and development (R&D) groups** of American, and Canadian origin. Members of such R&D groups deliberately altered the engineering designs, control software, and operational protocols of certain Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), while British ones endorsed those systems for international use. Their main motivation in making those alterations were to increase the lethality of their autonomous machines by removing or changing particular safeguards, safety mechanisms, design features, and operational protocols that were needed for preventing casualties. Such a decision was made with the awareness that its impacts would be detrimental to human safety for soldiers and civilians alike. The bad engineering decisions and judgments made by those professionals, directly caused death and destruction to allied soldiers as well as civilians during recent Afghan and Iraq wars. 

Many more incidents with mass civilian casualties have occurred over the years due to deliberate abuse of those autonomous systems, which had unconscionably increased lethality and larger area damaging capabilities pre-programmed into them. Additionally, on a number of occasions, this form of killing and destruction was due to the willful targeting of civilians far away from active battle zones, by US-led operators of those kinds of modified drones. During such incidents, military operators took control of the drones via the manual override of avionics installed in those automated machines, to deliberately target civilians in the Middle-East.

The span of time during which such deaths and destruction took place, as known to me at the end of year 2009, was from years 2003 to 2010. However, increasing number of reports from public news agencies since that time period, have highlighted ongoing civilian casualties and destruction to non-military targets from US-led combat groups that have been operating those very same, problematic manned as well as unmanned aerial vehicles for lethally violent purposes, in countries such as: Ukraine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Mali, Somalia, and Sudan.

## 1. Introduction

This documentation titled, *"Mass Murders of Civilians & Allied Soldiers By US-led Groups"* is organized into three parts. 

- *Part I, Chapters 1 - 9,* cover events I witnessed, and lived through during the years 2007 to 2017, which are related to incidents and violations involving unmanned vehicles, and US-led military personnel.

- *Part II, Chapters 10,* provides a list of entities that are to be held responsible for problems and issues discussed in *Part I,* along with a number of anticipated rebuttals of this material, which could be propped up by those entities. 

- *Part III, Chapters 11 - 12,* cover the events I've had to withstand from 2017 to the present year, in providing these materials to competent authorities.   

*Part I* begins with a discussion about ongoing genocides committed by various nations, and about how they have managed to get away with their crimes against humanity, for decades, using surreptitious methods. Governments along with corporate entities have committed more belligerent acts of genocide aside from clandestine ones, by alluding to pretexts like, "sovereign right to target civilians for national security," and "acceptable collateral damage during warfare." [*Chapters 1.1*](/1-1.md#11-a-right-to-commit-mass-murders-question-mark) and [*1.2*](/1-2.md#12-the-hypocrisy-and-pretense-of-superficially-humble-nation-states) critique such pretexts, specifically in reference to the subject of deliberate targeting of civilians, to show that genocides under any pretexts are reprehensible crimes, and are absolutely inexcusable, especially when they involve the government and corporate organizations of countries like Canada.    

The discussions provided in [*Chapter 2*](/2-0.md#2-seriousness-of-engineering-managerial-and-operational-errors-in-aviation) first explain why deaths, destruction, and damages caused due to engineering faults and errors — especially within the aviation industry — are critically significant issues, and are indeed a set of factors that lead to serious legal conflicts when they arises due to malpractices, or misconduct of professional workers. We will then cover the reasons and justifications for seeking relief, and resolutions, via legally binding, international interventions for redressing such serious conflicts, in [*Chapter 2.1.*](/2-1.md#21-main-reasons-for-seeking-relief-via-international-interventions) 

Next, in [*Chapters 3*](/3-0.md#3-violations-of-intellectual-property-and-moral-rights-of-workers-by-north-american-universities) and [*4*](/4-0.md#4-misuse-and-abuse-of-defense-systems-developed-via-universities-in-committing-genocides), we will look at the technical details of how particular types of engineering manipulations, and alterations made by R&D managers and supervisors employed via North American Universities, have continued to cause death and destruction of inordinate proportions, to innocent victims. In explaining those details, I would like to provide my testimony in [*Chapter 5*](/5-0.md#5-how-the-given-research-and-development-materials-came-to-be-retained), about how I retained certain pieces of material evidence about the role of drone technologies in systematized crimes against humanity. Those pieces of evidence are attached and included in the folder labeled, "[*/reference/files*](./reference/files)," of this repository. 

[*Chapter 6*](/6-0.md#6-testimonial-evidence-about-intentional-drone-strikes-on-civilians) provides my testimony about how I came to witness events of civilian mass killings — conducted by US-led armed forces using illegitimately obtained drones and automated systems. My testimony introduces an additional layer of complexity, and a legal conflict, about how my legal rights and honor, along with that of thousands of other international workers, have continued to be abused by US-led R&D groups, through deliberate actions of supervisors and authority figures at various levels of organization within those groups. Such deliberate actions were, and are still being carried out in violation of our moral and intellectual property rights. The intentional, forceful, and dishonorable practices of those supervising managers and officers, have illegally and unethically incorporated our labors and work products, into their genocidal activities and human rights violations — in a remorseless and unapologetic manner — against our formal protests.  

In addition to crimes like violations of intellectual property rights of thousands of workers, and mass murders of civilians via modified drones, the crimes committed by US-led groups include cover-ups of serial rapes, and stealthy procedures for torturing apprehended suspects, and prisoners of war by using: surgical, biochemical, thermal, electromechanical, and psychological techniques. [*Chapter 7*](/7-0.md#7-the-value-of-data-from-fitness-trackers-and-wearable-devices) highlights data-mining methods and analytical tools for examining time-stamped location data of US-led soldiers, indicating their whereabouts during their tours in the Middle-East, for comparing that information with time and location data about reported crimes involving military personnel and contractors. [*Chapter 8*](/8-0.md#8-blue-sky-projects-developed-and-deployed-via-north-american-universities) explains how particularly insidious procedures and techniques used for torturing apprehended civilians and prisoners of war, were developed and tested on citizens, residents, and refugees in North America, by conducting unethical experiments on subdued, mentally handicapped, captive human subjects — within on-campus as well as off-campus labs and facilities, belonging or affiliated to various North American universities. A number of those labs in North American university campuses that are funded by military and para-military groups, have remained operational, and are still conducting those types of heinous experiments on involuntary, captive, and vulnerable human beings. 

[*Chapter 9*](/9-0.md#9-personal-motivations-for-seeking-justice) highlights my personal motivations in seeking justice for persons like myself who have been exploited and harmed in a number of ways, by North American R&D groups affiliated to aerospace and defense industries. 

The industrially coordinated genocidal activities of various American-led R&D conglomerates, are still being committed, through continued exploitation of international workers who have a temporary, or a permanent resident status in Canada, EU, the UK, or in the US. Names of such international R&D conglomerates are provided in [*Part II, Chapter 10*](). Such exploitative conglomerates are to be held accountable for their direct involvement in facilitating serial mass killings of civilians, as well as for causing devastating harms to civilian properties across several geographic regions of the world. They are to be held accountable for their coordinated and intentionally destructive actions, as crimes against humanity. This documentation also provides the names of particular individual members from those R&D groups, who were directly involved in modifying drone based technologies, which have continued to cause harms to civilians in the Middle-East, and in various African countries. 

Following the technical details and my testimony pertaining to various issues, as explained in *Parts I & II* of this documentation, *Part III* provides an account of how these materials have been deliberately prevented from reaching the purview of appropriate legal scholars and judges, by Canadian agencies and their officers from provincial, as well as federal governments. In connection with the surreptitious deeds of those agents and agencies, continuous attempts have been made by a number of Canadian public service units, to cause judiciary officials from the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), Canada, to disingenuously disregarded, sideline, discount, or make light of such materials. These problematic issues of course, add yet another layer of legal complexity and conflict, regarding criminal violations of Canadian state-sponsored agents and agencies. Their underhanded activities have sought to discredit my work, assassinate my character, and obstruct the course of justice via malicious interference. They have continued to do so, by using subversive tactics along with acts of sabotage and subterfuge, to cause debilitation and death of targeted individuals. The involvement of North American agencies along with their internationally coordinated agents, in attempting to bury such probative materials, and in attempting to harm as well as fatally injure me in numerous ways, with intentions for silencing or suppressing whistleblowers like myself, has been inline with furthering the ongoing, industrially organized genocides being conducted by conglomerated forces, at a global-scale.

*Part III* also provides details about the more dastardly activities of state-sponsored authoritative actors, who prescribe punitive medicine via the abuse of medical facilities and medical sciences. Such vile actors abuse public services, and facilities related to healthcare, for committing acts of terror, torture, and murder, directed at dissidents and persons who are critical of governments from western nations. They have continued to do so in a bigoted manner, since the genocides committed against First Nations and indigenous peoples by the earliest European Settlers in North America, by using pretexts of "mental health rehabilitation, or re-education and assimilation, of 'waywardly' individuals and communities." 

For emphasis, the main arguments of this exposé are reiterated throughout this documentation: 

- Destructive and lethally harmful capabilities of automation based surveillance and combat technologies, were deliberately increased, by American and Canadian R&D managers — while continuously disregarding recommendations and protests, from several other workers, about safety issues arising from those altered engineering designs and operating procedures. 

- Unconscionable changes made to engineering designs and operational protocols, of systems pertaining to various models of drones built and sold by US-led R&D groups, to military and para-military operators, have repeatedly caused harms to soldiers from, and coalition soldiers allied with: Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia from being killed or maimed during their tours in the Middle-East. Similarly, such harms have continued to be caused to friendly soldiers, in various countries of the African continent. 

- The death toll, injuries, loss of livelihood, displacement from homes, and bereavement suffered by civilians because of destruction caused by missiles launched from, or guided by drones, has been more than "a few in number," and is in fact in the order of thousands of killed or wounded civilians per year since 2001, across international borders of African, and Middle-Eastern countries. 

- Misappropriated designs of conscientious workers have been illegally incorporated into, produced and deployed, aerospace and defense systems, via North American universities. Such illegitimately obtained and deployed systems, related to drone technologies, are still being misused and abused by military as well as quasi-military units of various countries. 

Sources confirming these observations are presented in subsequent Chapters. As such, this overall issue directly relates to the humanitarian and refugee crises being suffered by people of countries where such drones have been, and continue to be deployed for deliberately causing mass casualties and globally rampant humanitarian distress.
