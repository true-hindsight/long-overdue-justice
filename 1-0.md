# Mass Murders of Civilians and Allied Soldiers By US-led Groups

This documentation provides details on how civilians, and also allied soldiers of the US, were killed en mass, by various US-led groups due to misuse and abuse of drone based technologies. The word "drones" generally refers to unmanned, autonomous platforms operational on land, in air, at sea, and in outer space. However, here drones and drone based technologies as systems, mainly allude to aerial platforms or vehicles, equipped for reconnaissance and/or combat. 

In particular, the details showcased here, explain the roles of various persons involved in aviation related defense **research and development (R&D) groups** of American, and Canadian origin. Members of such R&D groups deliberately altered the engineering designs, control software, and operational protocols of certain Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), while British ones endorsed those systems for international use. Their main motivation in making those alterations were to increase the lethality of their autonomous machines by removing or changing particular safeguards, safety mechanisms, design features, and operational protocols that were needed for preventing casualties. Such a decision was made with the awareness that its impacts would be detrimental to human safety for soldiers and civilians alike. The bad engineering decisions and judgments made by those professionals, directly caused death and destruction to allied soldiers as well as civilians during recent Afghan and Iraq wars. 

Many more incidents with mass civilian casualties have occurred over the years due to deliberate abuse of those autonomous systems, which had unconscionably increased lethality and larger area damaging capabilities pre-programmed into them. Additionally, on a number of occasions, this form of killing and destruction was due to the willful targeting of civilians far away from active battle zones, by US-led operators of those kinds of modified drones. During such incidents, military operators took control of the drones via the manual override of safety features installed in those automated machines, to deliberately target civilians in the Middle-East. 

The span of time during which such deaths and destruction took place, as known to me at the end of year 2009, was from years 2003 to 2010. However, increasing number of reports from public news agencies since that time period, have highlighted ongoing civilian casualties and destruction to non-military targets from US-led combat groups that have been operating those very same, problematic manned as well as unmanned aerial vehicles for lethally violent purposes, in countries such as: Ukraine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Mali, Somalia, and Sudan.

## 1. Introduction

The following discussions and disclosures will first explain why a set of deaths, destruction, and damages caused due to engineering faults and errors — especially within the aviation industry — is a critically significant issue, and is indeed a serious legal conflict that arises because of malpractices and misconduct of professional workers. 

> **Egregious failures, malpractices and malfeasance — of engineers, scientists, managers, contractors, professional consultants, systems users and operators — that have caused and continue to cause deaths and destruction, are certainly not "a moot point for only academic or hypothetical discussions," for any *legitimate and competent* court of the law.**

Next, we will look at the technical details of the types of engineering manipulations and alterations that caused death and destruction of inordinate proportions to innocent victims. In explaining those details, I would like to provide my testimony about how I came to witness events of mass killings, and retained the pieces of material evidence included in this repository, about crimes against humanity. My testimony introduces an additional layer of complexity and a legal conflict, about how my own legal rights and honor were abused by those R&D groups due to their deliberate actions of illegally and unethically incorporating my labors as well as work products into their high-crimes and genocidal activities.  

Following the technical details of the issues explained here, I'd like to provide an account of how these disclosed materials were deliberately prevented from reaching the purview of appropriate legal scholars and judges, by Canadian agencies and their officers from provincial as well as federal governments. In connection with the surreptitious deeds of those agents and agencies, continuous attempts have been made by a number of Canadian public service units, to cause judiciary officials from the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), Canada, to disingenuously disregarded, sideline, discount, or make light of such materials. These issues of course, add yet another layer of legal complexity and conflict regarding criminal violations of Canadian state-sponsored agents and agencies that have sought to discredit my work, assassinate my character, obstruct the course of justice via malicious interference, and use ongoing subversive tactics to cause debilitation and death. Their involvement in attempting to bury such probative materials, and in attempting to harm as well as fatally injure me in numerous ways, with intentions for silencing or suppressing whistle-blowers like myself, only goes to further the ongoing genocides of civilians at an industrial and global-scale. The genocidal activities explained in this documentation are being committed by various American-led R&D conglomerates that have included Canadian R&D workers. Names of such international R&D conglomerates are provided in section [ ](). They are to be held accountable for their direct involvement in facilitating serial mass killings of civilians as well as for causing devastating harms to civilian properties across several geographic regions of the world. They are to be held accountable for their coordinated and deliberately destructive actions, as crimes against humanity. This documentation also provides the names of some of the individual members from those R&D groups who were directly involved in causing harms to civilians in the Middle-East, and in various African countries. 

For emphasis, the main argument of this expose is reiterated throughout this documentation: Destructive and lethally harmful capabilities of automation based surveillance and combat technologies were deliberately increased, by American and Canadian R&D workers — while continuously disregarding recommendations and protests from several workers about safety issues arising from those altered engineering designs and operating procedures, incorporated into the finally produced drone systems. The engineering designs and operational changes for increased lethality have continued to cause friendly soldiers from (and/or coalition soldiers who were allied with) Canada, the US, the UK, and Australia to be killed or maimed, during their tours in the Middle-East, and in various countries of the African continent. The death toll, injuries, loss of livelihood, displacement from homes, and bereavement due to destruction caused by missiles launched from, or guided by drones, has been more than "a few in number," and is in fact in the order of thousands of civilians per year since 2001, across international borders, in African and Middle-Eastern countries. Sources confirming these observations are presented in subsequent sections. As such, this overall issue directly relates to the humanitarian and refugee crises being suffered by people of those countries — countries where such drones have been and continue to be deployed for deliberately causing mass casualties and continuous humanitarian distress.
