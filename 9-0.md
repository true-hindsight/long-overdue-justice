## 9. Personal Motivations For Seeking Justice

>What kind of a person would ever pledge their allegiance and loyalties to serial mass rapists, serial mass torturers, and serial mass murderers? 

Given that I have never pledged any allegiance or loyalties to the American flag and its constitution, nor to the British flag and its constitution — by no means can I be labeled as a traitorous person for having recognized the industrial scale efforts of American and British-led conglomerates, in committing serial mass murders of civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq during the recent decades, and to then have filed a report against their war crimes involving mass rapes, tortures, abductions, massacres, and other such crimes against humanity to bureaus concerned with international affairs. 

To say that in producing such documentation and by making it available to particular government or non-government based organizations, I have somehow 'back-stabbed' my erstwhile employers, or have committed some type of "anti-American activities," would be unfair, and a thoroughly improper as well as wrongful characterization of my work and sentiments. This is because the people who deserve my loyalty are the honest, good, and just human beings of such countries and international R&D groups, who are concerned with genuine welfare and actual preservation of basic human rights — of all innocent people including survivors of wars. The work and labor I provided to US based employers via UIowa was misappropriated by those employers, which consequently demonstrates their lack of integrity from the very onset of the employment conditions set by them. As such, those particular groups and agencies, which acted as a chain of employers, had already betrayed the trust I had reposed in them, long before I came to know about their cruelty and lack of concern for basic human rights.  

Moreover, I completely and thoroughly reject the idea that I owe any forms of apologies, loyalties, favors, debts, or promises — to people who misused and abused my work while taking undue advantage of me as a ghostwriter via UIowa's Industrial Engineering department, within their clandestine schemes for "global full-spectrum-domination."  

If I were to stop fighting for the rights of civilians and friendly soldiers killed or injured by drone based technologies, it would directly imply that I approve of, and am allowing the use of my systems engineering related intellectual properties in the orchestration of mass murders and genocides of various peoples. In view of these events and facts, I absolutely cannot, in good conscience, permit or allow such atrocities to be committed via my misappropriated R&D works and labors.
