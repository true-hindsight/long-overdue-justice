## 7. Real-time Tracking and Assessment of Every Friend and Foe

We will first look at a bit of history about wearable technologies that collect users' physical activity data including physical location. And then we will go through a general overview of the method for tracking particular US-led personnel and contractors via their wearable technologies. The method presented here is at an introductory level, and the details of how to implement it aren't provided. Those who are more keen on learning about ways to implement it can follow the links provided in [the later part of this section.](#the-later-part-of-this-section)

At some point during the year 2018, I came across a news article in The Guardian, titled, ["Fitness tracking app Strava gives away location of secret US army bases"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases).

The Guardian's news report from 2018, about publicly available GPS data from Strava devices, was similar to the issues faced by US-led personnel in 2008-2009, because of data leakage from FitBit's wristbands, and Jawbone's wearable audio communication devices. Practically every other US army soldier, and the commanding officers of coalition soldiers, used to have some type of a "hands-free" communication device with them at all times, and a commercial-off-shelf fitness tracker. 

As a side note: [Fitbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit) is now owned by Alphabet Inc. (Google's holding company). And [AliphCom, i.e. Jawbone,](https://slidebean.com/story/is-jawbone-out-of-business) went out of business in the year 2017, in a spectacular way.

Coming back to leaky data-streams, the Strava data trove contains trillions of data points across years, from wristbands worn by US-led personnel, and military contractors, who were deployed to Afghanistan during "the war on terror." Apparently that data trove was floating around on the web for quite a few years, before somebody decided to make it more noticeable by writing to The Guardian about it. 

The fact that GPS location or navigational data, contained within leaked data-sets, reveals locations of forward bases used by US-led armed forces, isn't likely to be of great value, because much more detailed data about those bases is already available from satellite imagery. Even commercially available, daily satellite pictures of the earth's "arid regions," show the locations of various military installations along with the movement of vehicles to and from those facilities. 

However, the more intricate and nuanced behavioral analysis, which can be conducted using data gathered by fitness trackers and wearable communication devices, has to do with being able to convict, or exonerate, persons accused of committing crimes like thefts, rapes, and murders.

So, there are two necessary components of such analysis:

1. The information brought forth by the narratives of victims and survivors, which provides some knowledge about the time and location of assaults, and abductions; or similar details about acts of looting, plundering, and pillaging.

1. The information from a wearable device that collects real-time GPS location data, which can tie the accused to the reported crime scene.

<details><summary><b><em>Prevalent Injustice</em></b></summary>
In the context of rapes, and gang rapes of civilian victims in places like Afghanistan or Iraq, where sexual violence has continued to be used as an instrument of genocidal warfare, the narratives collected by aid-workers and non-government organizations from victims, survivors, and eye-witnesses has been repeatedly brushed aside and completely undermined, within various courts, using the following types of excuses:

1. The "tall tales" of so-called victims are false and baseless accusations. (The case is outright bogus.) 

1. The persons who have come forth with their accusations are no more than opportunistic con-artists, who are using malicious tactics to shake down the accused parties by threatening to spoil the good reputation and character of hard working, august, and upright armed forces personnel. (The case is motivated by illegitimate aims and designs, is too specious, and is highly doubt worthy.)

1. The victim's story is full of inconsistencies, memory lapses, and is "contaminated" with "emotional residue." (The case is too dirty and "icky.") 

1. The given matter, though tragic, is mainly due to happenstances and is being pursued by a misguided poor soul, who is on a quest for personal vendetta or a "witch-hunt." Such a case needs to be summarily dismissed as it is a waste of the court's precious resources. (The case is utterly misguided.) 

1. The given matter has been heavily conflated and confounded by the presenter with their "personal issues," due to their "personality disorder or mental afflictions." As such, the case is muddled beyond the capacity of the court, to be sorted out in a reasonable and fair-minded manner. The case must therefore be dismissed, or handed to a different process of adjudication, so that it can be better presented and handled else where, without demeaning the honor and dignity of the presiding court's officers. (The case is too tedious.)

1. It would be a futile and hopeless endeavor to pursue the matter because the accused persons have deceased, or cannot be located "despite the best efforts" of law enforcement agencies. (The case is simply worthless and lacks any merit.)

1. The plaintiffs have sought to exert undue influence over the court, by inciting public opinion against the defendants and ongoing legal procedures. Therefore, the matter needs to be summarily dismissed with prejudice! (The entirety of the case can only be considered within a socio-political vacuum, or not at all.)   

1. Prosecuting a commanding officer, or any higher-ups within the chain of command, of a "rogue soldier," is not feasible within existing legal frameworks and statutes of the civil court. (The case is about actions of a single bad apple that no form of humanly powers, or authorities could have prevented.) 

1. If a court marshal is to be paneled, the armed forces can do so, as per the rules, regulation, and cultural norms of the particular wing of the military where a staff, or an active duty member, stands accused, in matters concerning any type of dereliction, misconduct, or wrongful behaviors and activities of armed forces personnel. Also, if the consequence of any provable misdeeds and wrongdoings of the accused, happen to impact civilians or civilian facilities, then the matter is to be first legally analyzed and concluded by a military court or tribunal, before any civil suits can proceed, so as not to "muddy the waters," and to not "step on anybodies toes." (Dealing with this case is not within our job description.) 

1. Even if a statutory crime is discernible and provable beyond any conceivable doubt: prosecuting acts of sexual violence, or any type of misconduct involving coercion of individuals to perform sexual favors, or to perform any kinds of unethical, humiliating, degrading or dehumanizing activities, as directed by any members or contracted agents of the armed forces, is seen as a provocative issue that leads to politically charged conflagrations. (The case is too hot and toxic, it can't even be touched with a ten-foot pole by somebody wearing a hazmat suit.) 

At this point, one may exclaim, "But, wait! Which particular cases, if any, have had any of those aforementioned excuses used for obtaining any kind of a leave, or a dismissal? Where is the source or reference to the above types of 'colored' and 'colorful' claims?"

Do you have access to a thing called "Reuters' Westlaw Database?" If you do, please type in its search field, the keywords, 

```
"military + sexual violence"
```

You may then come to understand that: most number of cases involving sexual harm perpetrated against a civilian by a member of any military services, particularly during war-time, aren't even allowed to reach the stages of a hearing in a formal, court ordered proceeding, to be placed on the record; especially not on any kind of a record that isn't already heavily redacted, or completely sealed to the public.

When any of the above kinds of excuses are thrust by the defense team to sway the magistrate or the judge, more often than not, and for the better or for the worse, the "final" judgment delivered by most civil courtrooms is to deem the matter closed, without the necessity for any further discussions or arguments to be considered, except by a higher court, on the presented issues. Of course, the particular higher court that would need to hear the case, is made prohibitively expensive and inaccessible, by design, and is otherwise too busy with an ever increasingly massive backlog of unresolved cases. 

This is where one needs to meditate on the following questions: 

1. How have any unfair practices of a court with powers of self-absolution, ever been, or can ever be "for the worse," for the legal industry and for it members, especially, in comparison to the brunt of unfair legalized practices and systemic corruption that are invariably to the detriment of tax-payers, and which continue to add to the harms suffered by survivors of violent offenses?   

1. When have the lives and habitats of people in countries like Panama, Guam, Philippines, Laos, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Cyprus, Ethiopia, Sudan, Nigeria, Haiti, and Puerto Rico ever mattered, in comparison to the "pleasures, comforts, needs, wants, and interests" of persons in "esteemed places," of countries like the UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, or the US?
