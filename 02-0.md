## 2. Seriousness of Engineering, Managerial, and Operational Errors in Aviation

At the very onset, I'd like to draw your attention to the argument that:

> **Egregious failures, malpractices and malfeasance — of engineers, scientists, managers, contractors, professional consultants, systems users and operators — that have caused and continue to cause deaths and destruction, are certainly not "a moot point for only academic or hypothetical discussions," for a *legitimate and competent* court of the law.**

The practical concerns and grievous consequences of manned aerial vehicles crashing as a result of engineering, managerial, or operator based errors, happen to be widely known to the public via news reports, documentaries, and popular movies. However, the more nuanced concerns from a perspective of actuarial science and international law are known in greater details, to industry members and jurists, based on aircraft crash investigations reports published by agencies such as the US National Transportation Safety Board (US-NTSB), and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EUASA). 

For example, if concerns about safety and ethical utilization of airplanes, as known to experts and lay persons alike, weren't legitimate and significant, then fleets of *Boeing 737 MAX* aircraft would not have been grounded across the world, for years, when software and electromechanical design faults introduced by engineers, as well as policy based manipulations of managers in hiding those faults, were discovered by investigators. However, those discoveries concerning Boeing 737 MAX's flight control module called "Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System," with multiple points of failures, faults, and errors in the R&D and sales operations of the Boeing company, came to light only after irreparable losses and damages to civilian lives, on an international level, from [successive Boeing 737 MAX airplane crashes had already transpired.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings)  

Now, *Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)* happen to be a category of aircraft in the aviation industry, which serve civilian as well as military purposes, just like manned ones, based on their physical configuration and their usage by a human operator. UAVs are also known as *Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)* when the vehicles are considered together with their outer space, aerial, ground, or sea based communication relays, and command and control networks. The human operators who purchase or commission UAVs are typically state-sponsored entities, and are already aware of the type of missions or operations they are going to conduct because the UAV cannot otherwise be quickly reconfigured or refitted for a new purpose. The level of awareness and knowledge that an operator has about the capabilities of a particular UAV along with its attached systems, which they commissioned or purchased, comes from the information that is incorporated into the aircraft body and avionics systems as well as the information contained within the operator training procedures and protocols, as a pre-requisite to being able to properly use the procured UAVs. 

So, by no means do operators accidentally and surprisingly discover a capability of their purchased UAVs, to guide or launch missiles into crowded areas that generate mass civilian casualties! This is especially true, given that operators have repeatedly caused, and continue to cause mass civilian casualties and harms to friendly soldiers, via the misuse and abuse of UAVs. 

>Please see, recording of types of casualties from drone strikes, and issues within existing recording procedures: [New York Times, 2021-12-18](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-pentagon-records-civilian-deaths.html); [The Guardian, 2021-09-07](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/07/us-airstrikes-killed-at-least-22000-civilians-since-911-analysis-finds); [Wikipedia, 2023-01-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_from_U.S._drone_strikes)

The characteristic features of autonomous armed combat systems, are already known to, and designed by individuals in R&D groups who manufacture and sell those systems, including the unmanned vehicular platforms. The methods for verifying the destructive capabilities and effects produced on-ground, which include the use of *battle damage assessment videos* and *intelligence reports,* from active combat zones, are an integral part of the interactive and iterative, design and development life-cycles, of those platforms. Those kinds of videos and reports are invariable made available to particular R&D workers within R&D working groups.    

Additionally, the avionics systems onboard UAVs, which include software and hardware components for selecting and attacking targets with lethal or highly destructive effects, do have particular safety features and interlocking mechanisms to prevent harms that can be done to: identifiable civilians, non-combatants like reporters and aid workers, as well as friendly soldiers within the line of fire. Overriding those safety mechanisms and protocols during a mission is a judgment call made by mission commanders, which is typically within the "exclusive" domain and concern of the unmanned platform's military operators, during an ongoing battle. Consequently, a life-threatening challenge arises for civil society, when the definitions of active battle zone and ongoing battles, have no demarcating features in terms of time and geo-spatial locations. 

However, removing or disabling safety features is a much greater problem and a violation of industry standards, standards that are required for legitimate and appropriate use of those systems. The process of removing or disabling safety features from UAVs and its associated systems, during the design and research phase of their development, is a coordinated and collaborative decision made by multiple civilian R&D workers in a deliberate manner. Such deliberative actions are often conducted in coordination with direct oversight and influence from military officers over the design, production, and procurement process of those engineered systems. The R&D process usually also has civilian workers presenting design modifications to entice military agencies, due to the suppliers' economic motivations towards securing funding and procurement contracts. Those procurements necessarily involve tax-payer money that is utilized by government as well as private contractors from the aviation and defense industry sectors. Such R&D cycles involving tax based financing, various civilian agencies, professional consultants, and a large variety of multinational suppliers as well as contractors — have continued to negatively impact civil society at an international level and scale. 

In light of the aforementioned considerations, matters impacting civilian socio-economic well being, as well as physical safety and security of civilians across international borders, are most certainly not an exclusive domain of martial law; nor are the ongoing harms done by US-led R&D groups in defense and aviation industry sectors, somehow a separable concern pertinent only to the military, and that too, of only a single nation or a country.

More importantly, altering or hampering safety features installed in an internationally operated aviation system for causing harms or mayhem, or for destabilizing civilian facilities by causing civilian victims to suffer deaths and destruction, constitutes a crime within existing statutes of judiciary systems among countries that have a civil aviation ministry. Such violations involving internationally operated aerial systems aren't just minor infractions or slip ups that are somehow negligible. Such violations are serious legal disputes, which are appropriately recognized by particular courts of the law, which have national, or international scope of operations and jurisdictions. *Such as?* 

Now, if you are wondering which international bodies or institutions have the appropriate jurisprudence and jurisdiction, over such matters of serious gravity, we will get to that eventually. This section is for overcoming the psychological and political barriers as well as technical hurdles adopted by elected members of a number of institutions; institutions that were supposed to have sufficient legal oversight and competency for resolving the kinds of problems, and remedying the kinds of errors being showcased here. It is unfortunately true that those institutions, and a number of their influential members with titles of "Lordship," have somehow become arrogantly and unnecessarily inaccessible to thousands of victims, *because* of the sophistication and elevated international reputation of those institutions. So, if you as a reader, were to take offense with the previous statement, then it is possible that you are one of those particular Lords, or one of their "faithful" servants and staffers that I'm alluding to.

Coming back to our discussion about human made disasters at an international-scale: It can be observed that aviation industry's R&D structures and supply lines that involve various groups of people employed by multinational conglomerates, are definitely not a hidden mystery to investigative journalists, and investigators from international law enforcement agencies. Additionally, investigators must not be allowed to claim any excuses such as, "the production as well as sales activities of conglomerates in aviation industry and markets, are utterly inscrutable." These kinds of paltry excuses cannot be allowed to hold ground, nor can they be allowed to form the basis of inaction, especially when R&D documents showcasing the means and motives of particular organizations, in completely downgrading the value of human lives of civilians and friendly soldiers — are being directly handed to them via such documentation by an industry insider — including a detailed walk-through about the follies of various R&D workers, for the purposes of internationally binding adjudications and ratified resolutions from open parliamentary discussions.

An authoritative agency of the law that automatically rejects the validity, authenticity, and thrust of the given evidence, without proper justifications, would only prove its obstinance and lack of scruples. So, the task of carefully and methodically vetting given pieces of evidence, about ongoing violations of industry standards and basic human rights, can obviously take some time and resources. Of course, the required evaluation of any given evidence, to check for its truthfulness and admissibility, must not take indefinite time, and infinite resources.   

***Therefore, is there any reason why a number of concerned agencies that aren't beholden to each other, cannot simultaneously and independently scrutinize a given set of evidence pertaining to discernible legal conflicts, in order to cross-check and verify the findings of each other? Additionally, given that monitoring or addressing such legal conflicts are already within the diagram of their official duties and capabilities, what can the offending parties do to stop me, from reaching out to those agencies in earnest and good faith?*** 

This documentation along with its accompanying files have thus been made available to the government agencies responsible for protecting the fundamental rights, liberties, and interests of their citizens — particularly in reference to ongoing violations committed by certain defense and aviation related civilian agencies from North America, and the UK, with participatory contributions from European and Australian agencies — and in the context of increasing damages suffered by people of several countries in terms of unnecessary losses to lives, limbs, livelihoods, and properties of civilians because of distinctly untoward actions committed by US-led R&D groups associated with the global aviation industry.
