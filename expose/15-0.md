Let us now discuss the status quo, and the foreboding future.

    <b>Remedies and recompense obtainable, can be sought in parallel via multiple options</b>
</p>

<br>

Remedies and recompense obtainable by whom, and for what? Remedies and restitution are to be obtained by those who are owed a debt of some kind. Recompense, is for all those who commit any type of deeds. 

However, this documentary is chiefly about the debt owed by offending countries and organizations, to victims and survivors of hostile or genocidal activities; particularly, genocides orchestrated against peoples of color and marginalized communities. I merely ended up being one more person who was molested and made to suffer harms, due to the genocidal activities and deeply offensive cruelties committed by Canadian state-sponsored agencies. I had to endure murderous and insidious actions thrust upon my diaspora and family, by wretched operatives active in Canada, simply because I wasn't the first, nor am I among the last of the selectively targeted people, to have fallen prey to the genocidal apparatus wielded by Canadian institutions against Muslims, ethnic minorities, peoples of color, aboriginal, indigenous and First Nations peoples, and other susceptible as well as vulnerable people like persons with disabilities, refugees, and newcomers.  

Now, of all the people, persons from the University of Waterloo's faculty, management, and leadership, ought to understand that encouraging students to "embrace the gray area" of morality and ethics, isn't a wise or a good idea. 

Likewise, *Universities Canada* and other state-sponsored entities such as *Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, Canada*, *Waterloo Regional Police Services,* and *Grand River Hospitals and Clinics,* also need to set a better example for onlookers from the international community, by changing their injurious means and duplicitous aims. They are to redress the long-standing issues stemming from the endemic bigotry baked into their organizational structures, by providing sincere apologies and compensations, to individuals and communities they have harmed. Needless to say, they simply have to permanently halt all forms of hurtful, discriminatory, xenophobic, racist, and surreptitious practices that they have continued to incorporate in their organizational culture, thus far. 

Furthermore, we aren't going to be even or squared up, in any sense of those words, until Canadian authorities fulfill the terms and conditions in *Appendix VI, of the File.* 

At this juncture, perhaps some of you might advice me to, "Pick and choose your battles carefully." 

To those readers and well-wishers, I would like to say, "Pick and chose *your* means and ends carefully, because [battles can choose *you* to play a role within them](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/imgs/infinitely_blooming_fire_maze.png), even if you had never intended to willingly opt-in, to do so." 

North American entities named and implicated in this situation, please do have a chat with your ministry of defense after properly going through: 

1. [0A](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/0A.md) 

1. [0B](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/0B.md) 

1. [0C](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/0C.md) 

1. [0D](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/0D.md) 

And no matter what you do, please do not embrace "the gray area" or the darkness lurking in every other aspect of daily life. Instead, face the light, and stand tall with some honor, dignity, grace, and humility, so that you can prepare for **The Judgment Day,** like the rest of us.
