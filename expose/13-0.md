## 13. LSO's Involvement in Protecting Canadian Threat Actors

Canada has not had the decency, nor the discipline, to honestly pay reparations to victims and survivors of genocides and human rights violations, committed by its state-sponsored agencies, religious organizations, public service units, and authority figures. This inglorious fact cannot be hidden by any of the dishonorable cover ups and indemnities shored up by entities like Canada's Defense Ministry, or the Law Society of Ontario (LSO).

The only reason my family and I were put through devastating and ruinous harms, from a range of discriminatory offenses and violence committed by Canadian threat actors, was because of the types of immunity, and indemnities Canadian state-sponsored agents as well as Canada's public, and private sector agencies have given themselves, via support of entities like the LSO. Those agencies and their authorized agents continue to commit serial acts of inequitable treatment, thefts, fraudulence, malpractices, harassment, abductions, and murders with genocidal intentions, while pretending to be placid, international vanguards of basic human rights and civil liberties. Any evidence of their crimes is not even allowed to appear in a court because of the dastardly tactics deployed by persons affiliated with the LSO, or with the judiciary and legislative systems in Canada.

When Justices of The Peace in any part of Canada issues a writ or an order of any kind, they might as well consider if they are aiding organized crimes and genocidal activities through their actions. However, if those justices have been indoctrinated by age-old colonialists and supremacists, or, if they are political appointees who happen to be obtuse and ill-qualified, how will they manage to be conscientious about their legal decisions, and correct in their issued judgments?

  <b>The imbalance is plainly evident and apparent!</b>

<br>

The above form of skewed imbalance in observable behaviors of Canadian agencies, compared to any open and frank individual's voiced concerns, is not supposed to be some sort of 'a Pareto efficiency', achieved via the passive-aggressive tactics of Canada's parliamentarians, jurists, and puritanical British loyalists. Nor is the issue of unpaid reparations, and overdue restitution for Canada's state-sponsored atrocities, a foregone, or a settled matter. 

Undoubtedly and unquestionably: 

>The successive heads of Canada's provincial and federal governments, didn't somehow forget to pay their respects and dues to humanity, day-after-day, and year-after-year for the past century by virtue of their 'innocence'; they have instead, willingly and forcefully orchestrated every strategy conceivable, to thoroughly handicap and then eradicate, targeted communities and individuals from Canada who happen to be peoples of color, or "Semitic." 

Additionally, when considering the above shown diagram about the centrality of this situation, adding 'verbose' or 'derisive' onto the right-hand side of the scales, will not make them budge to any extent. So, which kind of events or forces can actually set the correct balance, in a publicly verifiable way?

One can logically state that the appropriate form of justice can be established and served, towards genuine reconciliations, only when Canada publicly apologies for its series of wrongdoings, and dutifully pays the remedies owed to every set of harmed victims and survivors, without any forms of delays, evasions, hesitancy, or reservations. 

All excuses and stall tactics adopted via policies, protocols, and practices of organizations like the LSO which cause attrition to already suffering individuals, in matters pertaining to legal remedies and punitive damages in need of being assessed for state-sponsored wrongdoings or malpractices, are only an added number of violations committed by Canada; and are a deplorable insult to injury, thrust upon victims and survivors of state-sponsored injustices. 

In this situation, Canada does not have the right to implement any kind of "statutes of limitation", judgments in rem, or any kind of judgments in absentia of survivors, because it has continued to violate the basic human rights of snared people from local as well as international communities, in discriminatory and targeted ways. 

Would any living persons like to claim that the allegations made in these documents are wild, obscene, or baseless? With which kind of an authority, and with which face that can be shown to the public, can they possibly attempt to defend Canadian threat actors against the facts presented in this documentation? Canada's sordid and rancorous violations against human ecology, indigenous and First Nations peoples, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups have continued unabated for decades on a daily basis, and they cannot be allowed to continue any longer! 

Canada's unwillingness to dutifully pay reparations, and inability to provide satisfactory justice to wronged peoples and individuals, is because it has continued to lack the required rectitude and righteousness, within each and every echelon of its societal structures. 

The ongoing abhorrent, and contemptuous deeds of Canada's key institutions, is an affront to all of nature, humanity, and to future generations of human beings; for even newborns will come to suffer due to the inter-generational harms propagated by Canada's fiduciary agencies, and by the vested officers of its private organizations and public service entities.  

Shame on you Canada! Shame on you!
