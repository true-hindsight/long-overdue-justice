### 2.1 Main Reasons for Seeking Relief via International Interventions

As a recapitulation, the following list of issues are the main reasons for producing this documentation, and for making it publicly viewable: 

1. Ongoing mass casualties and debilitating injuries suffered by friendly soldiers and civilians, in various and several countries, because of illegitimate actions taken by members of US-led R&D groups that are associated with the aviation and defense industry

1. Continued destruction to civilian facilities and properties, in various and several countries, because of illegitimate actions taken by members of US-led R&D groups that are associated with the aviation and defense industry

1. Inaccessible and unaffordable design of existing courts that are in charge of settling such international disputes in a civilized, timely, and effective manner 

Aforementioned issues have not been properly redressed by international courts of law that are concerned with cross-border human rights violations and crimes against humanity. To say that pursuing these issues would be futile, or a waste of a court's resources, would be disingenuous because allowing such issues to grow and persist, would only lead to armed-retaliations against existing offenders from North America, the EU, and the UK. Additionally, a court's double standards and hypocrisy in dealing with such issues would become plainly evident and obvious, if any one of the drone related R&D groups and operators from countries like Russia, Iran, or China were to be sued in the court, for any kind of unmanned vehicle related errors, offenses, or violations — while neglecting, downplaying, or abetting the malfeasance of similar R&D groups and operators from North America, the EU, and the UK. Consequently, that type of a court would become discriminatory and unfair, and would also become unworthy of the respect, credence, and acceptance offered to it by conscientious human beings. 

It must be correctly acknowledged, that the death and destruction caused as a result of professional malpractices and malfeasance, among members of aviation related R&D groups, has already become extensive and large, and worse, it has been increasing at an accelerated pace, due to the growth in sales of faulty defense systems promoted by regulated, as well as unregulated international arms dealers. The extensive proliferation of weapons based on autonomous or automated technologies, which have already become cheaply and readily available to state as well as non-state actors, is a major cause for concern in matters of national security and basic human safety. Such concerns are particularly strong and valid for the international community, with respect to the active armed-conflict-zones within Eastern Europe, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and within Indo-Pacific regions of the world. 

The current losses and upcoming risks posed to daily lives of people across the globe, as well as the financial risks posed particularly to the civil aviation and insurance industry — from improperly regulated, and uncontrolled international trade of semi-autonomous, and autonomous defense systems — is at the scale of tens of billions of euros per year within merely the aviation related sectors involving UAVs[^1]. This is not an insignificant value of existing risks and losses, specifically when it can be preventable or mitigated through timely legal injunctions.

The combination of geopolitical and technological factors involving continuous increase in unchecked cross-border sales of drones, and the international proliferation of drone based technologies, indicates that without legal interventions, that is, without the lawful enforcement of existing international conventions and norms upon subscribing nations of UN charters, the ability of various state-sponsored as well as non-state-sponsored actors to commit mass murders and serial crimes against humanity using drones, will only keep increasing at an exponential magnitude of strength and frequency — with dire consequences and impacts upon the world as a whole. 

It follows from the above discussion that the measurable volume of harm to humanity and human ecology, in terms of thousands of deaths, millions of displaced refugees, and billions of euros in losses per year to various countries till date, since the beginning of the year 2000, is ample proof that this subject matter, involving an increasing number of legal conflicts at an international-scale, isn't just "hypothetical," nor is it merely academic in nature. Most importantly, it can be observed with complete confidence and certainty, that any issues involving misuse and abuse of international aviation standards, are not the type of conflicts that would be impractical, marginal, non-critical, hypothetical, or only academic upon pursuing them to their resolution.
