### 10.1 Technical Definitions

These definitions are presented as per the first appearance of a terminology within [Chapter 10.0](), instead of an alphabetical order, to highlight the logical dependency of subsequent terms on explanations and meanings of prior terms, or phrases. 

1. ***[Abstraction Hierarchy][id-01]***: A mathematical graph with a representation of cognizable concepts, along with their intertwined relationships. The graph of identifiable concepts are laid out, and mapped along two orthogonal axes of a table. The tabulated form can then be utilized as a starting point for creating, as well as a quality control template for evaluating, engineered systems. 

    <details><summary>More details and example:</summary>

    1. The first axis denotes the semantic continuum of part-whole relationships, from a modal logic and systems perspective. 

    1. The second axis denotes the continuum of tangible (i.e. concrete and specific), versus, the intangible (i.e. abstract and generic) nature of each individuated concept being graphed, with respect to human sense organs and cognitive faculties, as per the science of [human factors and ergonomics](). 

    1. This method of tabulation accounts for anthropological, cultural, lexical, and ethnographic connotations associated with each identifiable concept represented as mathematical objects, with graph based nodes and edges, in a hierarchical vector space. Doing so is necessary for building [natural language processing]() algorithms, and other types of programmable algorithms for [artificial intelligence]() based systems. Such algorithms can utilize the given graph based lexicon, i.e. a relational database of words crafted by human beings such as researchers, engineers, and technicians, to perform various automated or semi-automated tasks and functions within a physical environment.

    1. The accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the programmable and engineered system, cannot be properly defined without this tabulation.

    1. The part-whole relationships among tabulated or graphically represented concepts are measurable, objective, and provable via set theoretic principles. The degree of abstractness of a tabulated concept, is subjective and dependent on the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the craftsperson who authors and manually creates a particular instance of an Abstraction Hierarchy. Thus, the objective as well as subjective aspects of real-world human experiences, pertaining to a field of study and work, can be modeled or represented, by single or collaborating authors of Abstraction Hierarchies.  

    1. Abstraction Hierarchies in the form of tabulated or graphical representations, form the ground truth, and basis of categorization as well as classification algorithms, that are needed for producing codified software components of artificial intelligence based robots, like unmanned vehicles i.e. drones. Such graphical tables are also necessary for creating user manuals, safety protocols, and addressing performance issues of the automation. They are necessarily used for creating and evaluating trained behaviors of the managers, supervisors, and operators who purchase, utilize, and operate the technological system, from the lens of operation's research and organizational psychology. 

    1. Example:
    ```
    Unstructured list of concepts: brand value, vehicle, engine, driverless, Toyota, trustworthy, cost, V12 Engine, Lamborghini, durable, mileage.

                 Part                                                            Whole
              (component)                                                      (assembly)
    ```

    1. From the above example (diagram), it can be conveniently seen that a "Driverless-Lamborghini" would be pointless because it would not add any value to Lamborghini's brand value. However, a "Driverless-Toyota-Vehicle" could be feasible if the appropriate level of trustworthiness could be economically instilled into the minds of customers, through a set of design and business decisions pertaining to concepts like durability, and type of engine. In this manner, Abstraction Hierarchies serve as an indispensable tool for conducting cost analysis, creating a bill of materials for a product, designing user-interaction maps, evaluating design alternatives, and even for making legally sound business decisions from available options.
