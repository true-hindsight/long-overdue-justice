### 10.1 Technical Definitions

These terminologies are presented in the order of their first appearance within [Chapters 8.1](../08-1.md), and [10.0](../10-0.md), instead of an alphabetical order. This is for highlighting the logical dependency of subsequent terms on explanations, and meanings of prior terms, or phrases. 

#### 1. Abstraction Hierarchy

A mathematical graph with a representation of cognizable concepts, along with their intertwined relationships. The graph of identifiable concepts are laid out, and mapped along two orthogonal axes of a table. The tabulated form can then be utilized as a starting point for creating, as well as a quality control template for evaluating, engineered systems. 

<details><summary>More details and example:</summary>

1. The first axis denotes the semantic continuum of part-whole relationships, from a modal logic and systems perspective. 

1. The second axis denotes the continuum of tangible (i.e. concrete and specific), versus, the  abstract (i.e. intangible and generic) nature of each individuated concept being graphed, with respect to human sense organs and cognitive faculties, as per the science of [human factors and ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics). 

1. Example:
    ```
    Unstructured list of concepts: 
        brand value, vehicle, engine, driverless, Toyota, trustworthy,  
        cost, V12 Engine, Lamborghini, durable, mileage.

1. From the above example (diagram), when we track the concepts from Tangible-Parts towards an Abstract-Whole, we can conveniently notice that a *"Driverless-Lamborghini"* would be pointless because it would not add any value to Lamborghini's brand value. However, a *"Driverless-Toyota-Vehicle"* could be worthwhile if the appropriate level of trustworthiness could be economically instilled into the minds of customers for purchasing it, borne out of a set of design and business decisions made by the company, pertaining to concepts like the vehicle's durability, and type of engine. In this manner, Abstraction Hierarchies serve as an indispensable tool for doing feasibility and impact studies, and can also be used for creating a bill of materials for a product, designing user-interaction maps, evaluating design alternatives, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and even for making legally sound business decisions from available options.  

1. This method of tabulation accounts for anthropological, cultural, lexical, and ethnographic connotations associated with each identifiable concept represented as mathematical objects, with graph based nodes and edges, in a hierarchical vector space. Doing so is necessary for building [natural language processing]() algorithms, and other types of programmable algorithms for [artificial intelligence]() based systems. Such algorithms can utilize the given graph based lexicon, i.e. a relational database of words crafted by human beings such as researchers, engineers, and technicians, to perform various automated or semi-automated tasks and functions within a physical environment.

1. The accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the programmable and engineered system, cannot be properly defined without these types of methodical tabulations.

1. The part-whole relationships among tabulated or graphically represented concepts are measurable, objective, and provable via set theoretic principles. The degree of abstractness of a tabulated concept, is subjective and dependent on the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the craftsperson who authors and manually creates a particular instance of an Abstraction Hierarchy. Thus, the objective as well as subjective aspects of real-world human experiences, pertaining to a field of study and work, can be modeled or represented, by single or collaborating authors of Abstraction Hierarchies.  

1. Abstraction Hierarchies in the form of tabulated or graphical representations, form the ground truth, and basis of categorization as well as classification algorithms, that are needed for producing codified software components of systems driven by artificial intelligence, like unmanned vehicles i.e. drones. Such graphical tables are also necessary for creating user manuals, safety protocols, and addressing performance issues of the automation. From the lens of operation's research and organizational psychology: abstraction hierarchies are used for creating and evaluating trained behaviors of the managers, supervisors, and operators who purchase, utilize, and operate the technological system.

#### 1. Work Domain Analysis

A framework for creating an analytical description of the physical, historical, sociological, political, economic and technological aspects of an observable environment for the purposes of doing safe, value added and earnest human labor within that environment. 
Such an analytical description typically involves an Abstraction Hierarchy that categorically describes each and every entity of elemental and ensemble nature that can be made discernible to a human being who is exposed to the particular environment. 
A Work Domain analysis is often necessary for identifying hazards and foundational faults within systems that operate in an observed ecology which can give way to zero-day-hacks of those susceptible systems.
