### 10.1 Technical Definitions

These terminologies are presented in the order of their first appearance within [*Chapters 8.1*](../08-1.md), and [*10.0*](../10-0.md) of this documentation, instead of an alphabetical order. This is for highlighting the logical dependency of subsequent terms on explanations and meanings of prior terms, and phrases. 

#### 1. Abstraction Hierarchy

A mathematical graph with a representation of cognizable concepts, along with their intertwined relationships. The graph of identifiable concepts are laid out, and mapped along two orthogonal axes of a table. The tabulated form can then be utilized as a starting point for creating, as well as a quality control template for evaluating, engineered systems. 

<details><summary>More details and example:</summary>

1. The first axis denotes the semantic continuum of part-whole relationships, from a modal logic and systems perspective. 

1. The second axis denotes the continuum of tangible (i.e. concrete and specific), versus, the  abstract (i.e. intangible and generic) nature of each individuated concept being graphed, with respect to human sense organs and cognitive faculties, as per the science of [human factors and ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics). 

1. Example:
    ```
    Unstructured list of concepts: 
        brand value, vehicle, engine, driverless, Toyota, trustworthy,  
        cost, V12 Engine, Lamborghini, durable, mileage.

1. From the above example (diagram), when we track the concepts from Tangible-Parts towards an Abstract-Whole, we can conveniently notice that a *"Driverless-Lamborghini"* would be pointless because it would not add any value to Lamborghini's brand value. However, a *"Driverless-Toyota-Vehicle"* could be worthwhile if the appropriate level of trustworthiness could be economically instilled into the minds of customers for purchasing it, borne out of a set of design and business decisions made by the company, pertaining to concepts like the vehicle's durability, and type of engine. In this manner, Abstraction Hierarchies serve as an indispensable tool for doing feasibility and impact studies, and can also be used for creating a bill of materials for a product, designing user-interaction maps, evaluating design alternatives, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and even for making legally sound business decisions from available options.  

1. This method of tabulation accounts for anthropological, cultural, lexical, and ethnographic connotations associated with each identifiable concept represented as mathematical objects, with graph based nodes and edges, in a hierarchical vector space. Doing so is necessary for building [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) algorithms, and other types of programmable algorithms for [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Goals) based systems. Such algorithms can utilize the given graph based lexicon, i.e. a relational database of words crafted by human beings such as researchers, engineers, and technicians, to perform various automated or semi-automated tasks and functions within a physical environment.

1. The accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the programmable and engineered system, cannot be properly defined without these types of methodical tabulations.

1. The part-whole relationships among tabulated or graphically represented concepts are measurable, objective, and provable via set theoretic principles. The degree of abstractness of a tabulated concept, is subjective and dependent on the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the craftsperson who authors and manually creates a particular instance of an Abstraction Hierarchy. Thus, the objective as well as subjective aspects of real-world human experiences, pertaining to a field of study and work, can be modeled or represented, by single or collaborating authors of Abstraction Hierarchies.  

1. Abstraction Hierarchies in the form of tabulated or graphical representations, form the ground truth, and basis of categorization as well as classification algorithms, that are needed for producing codified software components of systems driven by artificial intelligence, like unmanned vehicles i.e. drones. Such graphical tables are also necessary for creating user manuals, safety protocols, and addressing performance issues of the automation. From the lens of operation's research and organizational psychology: abstraction hierarchies are used for creating and evaluating trained behaviors of the managers, supervisors, and operators who purchase, utilize, and operate the technological system.

#### 2. Work Domain Analysis

A framework for creating an analytical description of the physical, historical, sociological, political, economic and technological aspects of an observable environment — for the purposes of doing safe, value added, legal, and earnest human labor within the described environment. 

<details><summary>More details:</summary>
1. Such an analytical description typically involves an Abstraction Hierarchy that categorically describes each and every entity of elemental, and ensemble nature of systems like power plants and airports, that a human being can be exposed to during a particular context of work done in a physical environment. 

1. A Work Domain Analysis, is necessary for identifying hazards and faults present within systems that owners, operators, and bystanders can be exposed to, in an observed ecology. Such hazards and faults naturally lead to liabilities, but can also give way to *zero-day-hacks* of susceptible and improperly managed systems. The analysis consequently provides methods and policies for mitigating risks. 

1. It is useful in identifying the type of work that can and ought to be done, in environments like: semantic space generated by wide-area connectivity of internet enabled devices ([IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), deep ocean, and outer space. These types of environments are being newly explored, especially by military and commercial operators seeking a sustainable foothold in those domains.

#### 3. Ecological Interface Design

Ecological Interface Design facilitates human-human, and human-machine interactions within an "ecology." The term ecology includes anthropological and physical facets of an environment where a network of resources, devices, machines, and human beings co-exist. 

A study and research of ecological relationships among co-existing networks yields constraints i.e. rules that govern the behavior of those networks. These constraints are to be adhered to, by persons and agencies existing in the ecology, for the sake of preserving or enhancing the health, productivity, performance, evolution, and sustainability of those networks. 

Intentionally displaying those discovered constraints or rules, in specific and timely ways to the end-users, guides those end-users towards becoming well informed, and also towards formulating viable goals, behaviors, and activities. The technological and engineering based methods for creating policies, tools and methods for conveying said constraints 


Constraints and boundaries within an ecology are also known as "affordences" in the context of Ecological Interface Design. It has exactly the same meaning and usage as "sanctions." Affordences or sanctions, restrict or enable particular degrees of freedom that an agent can have within an ecology. 

Structuring an agent's intention that can permeate via synthetic guide rails contrived by human beings (guiding principles like social norms and conventions), or natural ones (like physical laws of thermodynamics and electromagnetism), is the main aim of Ecological Interface Design. The value or worth, of any particular set of guiding structures is acknowledged as being culturally dependent, and also as being contextually bounded to "the end-user" of the interface. The word end-user is often taken as the technical and legal term used in contractual agreements for goods and services rendered by an agent.  

Examples on how to build an Abstraction Hierarchy, when conducting a Work Domain Analysis, are explained within this following article on Ecological Interface Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_interface_design  

Some more details about how ecological interface design plays an integral role in industrial and systems engineering is explained here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_interface_design
