### 10.1 Technical Definitions

These terminologies are presented in the order of their first appearance within [*Chapters 8.1*](../08-1.md), and [*10.0*](../10-0.md) of this documentation, instead of an alphabetical order. This is for highlighting the logical dependency of subsequent terms on explanations and meanings of prior terms, and phrases. 

#### 1. Abstraction Hierarchy

A mathematical graph with a representation of cognizable concepts, along with their intertwined relationships. The graph of identifiable concepts are laid out, and mapped along two orthogonal axes of a table. The tabulated form can then be utilized as a starting point for creating, as well as a quality control template for evaluating, engineered systems. 

<details><summary>More details and example:</summary>

1. The first axis denotes the semantic continuum of part-whole relationships, from a modal logic and systems perspective. 

1. The second axis denotes the continuum of tangible (i.e. concrete and specific), versus, the  abstract (i.e. intangible and generic) nature of each individuated concept being graphed, with respect to human sense organs and cognitive faculties, as per the science of [human factors and ergonomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics). 

1. Example:
    ```
    Unstructured list of concepts: 
        brand value, vehicle, engine, driverless, Toyota, trustworthy,  
        cost, V12 Engine, Lamborghini, durable, mileage.

               (component)                                                       (assembly)
    ```

1. From the above example (diagram), when we track the concepts from Tangible-Parts towards an Abstract-Whole, we can conveniently notice that a *"Driverless-Lamborghini"* would be pointless, because it wouldn't add any value to Lamborghini's brand value of, "experiencing the excitement of being in the driver's seat of a super car." However, a *"Driverless-Toyota-Vehicle"* could be worthwhile for, "experiencing the serenity of not being in the drivers seat of a taxi or a delivery van," if the appropriate level of trustworthiness could be economically instilled into the minds of customers for purchasing it. A method for encouraging consumer confidence in a driverless vehicle would be borne out of a set of design and business decisions, made by the company, pertaining to concepts like the vehicle's durability and type of engine; and even concepts like "consumer satisfaction." In this manner, Abstraction Hierarchies serve as an indispensable tool for doing feasibility and impact studies, and can also be used for creating a bill of materials for a product, designing user-interaction maps, evaluating design alternatives, conducting cost-benefit analyses, and even for making legally defensible business decisions from available options.  

1. This method of tabulation accounts for anthropological, cultural, lexical, and ethnographic connotations associated with each identifiable concept represented as mathematical objects, with graph based nodes and edges, in a hierarchical vector space. Doing so is necessary for building [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) algorithms, and other types of programmable algorithms for [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Goals) (AI) based systems. Such algorithms can utilize the given graph based lexicon, i.e. a relational database of words. The database are crafted by researchers, engineers, and technicians, to train the AI for performing various automated or semi-automated tasks, and functions, within a physical environment.

1. The accuracy, precision, and efficiency of the programmable and engineered system, cannot be properly defined without these types of methodical tabulations.

1. The part-whole relationships among tabulated or graphically represented concepts are measurable, objective, and provable via set theoretic principles. The degree of abstractness of a tabulated concept, is subjective and dependent on the knowledge, experience, and expertise of the craftsperson who authors and manually creates a particular instance of an Abstraction Hierarchy. Thus, the objective as well as subjective aspects of real-world human experiences, pertaining to a field of study and work, can be modeled or represented, by single or collaborating authors of Abstraction Hierarchies.  

1. Abstraction Hierarchies in the form of tables or graphs, form the ground truth and the basis for subsequent categorization as well as classification algorithms, in an AI training schedule, or pipeline. As such, these truth tables are necessary for producing codified software components of systems driven by an AI, like unmanned vehicles i.e. drones. Such graphical tables are also necessary for creating user manuals, safety protocols, and addressing performance issues of the automation. 

1. From the lens of operation's research and organizational psychology: Abstraction Hierarchies are used for creating and evaluating trained behaviors of the managers, supervisors, and operators who purchase, utilize, and operate a technological system within a domain.

#### 2. Work Domain Analysis

A framework for creating an analytical description of the physical, historical, sociological, political, economic and technological aspects of an observable environment — for the purposes of doing safe, value added, legal, and earnest human labor within the described environment. 

<details><summary>More details:</summary>

1. Such an analytical description typically involves an Abstraction Hierarchy that categorically describes each and every entity of elemental, and ensemble nature of systems like power plants and airports, that a human being can be exposed to during a particular context of work done in a physical environment. 

1. A Work Domain Analysis, is necessary for identifying hazards and faults present within systems that owners, operators, and bystanders can be exposed to, in an observed ecology. Such hazards and faults naturally lead to liabilities, but can also give way to *zero-day-hacks* of susceptible and improperly managed systems. The analysis consequently provides methods and policies for mitigating risks. 

1. It is useful in identifying the type of work that can and ought to be done, in environments like: semantic space generated by wide-area connectivity of internet enabled devices ([IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), deep ocean, and outer space. These types of environments are being newly explored, especially by military and commercial operators seeking a sustainable foothold in those domains.

1. Here is primer on the subject: [*Work Domain Analysis Concepts, Guidelines, and Cases* By Neelam Naikar](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.1201/b14774/work-domain-analysis-neelam-naikar)

#### 3. Ecological Interface Design

Ecological Interface Design facilitates human-human, and human-machine interactions within an "ecology." The term ecology includes anthropological and physical facets of an environment where a network of resources, devices, machines, and human beings co-exist. 

A study and research of ecological relationships among co-existing networks yields constraints i.e. rules that govern the behavior of those networks. These constraints are to be adhered to, by persons and agencies existing in the ecology, for the sake of preserving or enhancing the health, productivity, performance, evolution, and sustainability of those networks. 

Intentionally displaying discovered constraints or rules, in specific and timely ways to the "end-users" and persons impacted by a system, guides those end-users and persons towards becoming well informed, and also towards formulating viable goals, behaviors, and activities. The technological and engineering based design process for creating and deploying policies, tools, and training methods for conveying said constraints to various people interacting with a system, is called Ecological Interface Design.

<details><summary>More details:</summary>

1. Among Ecological Interface Designers, constraints and boundaries that already exist, and can potentially exist within an ecology, are colloquially known as "affordences." Though the word is unlikely to be found in any English dictionary, it has exactly the same meaning and usage as "sanctions." An Affordence or a sanction, restricts or enables particular degrees of freedom that an agent can have, in order to think or act, within an ecology. 

1. The main aim of Ecological Interface Design is to structure an agent's intentions that can permeate in an ecology, via synthetic guide rails contrived by human beings, like philosophical principles, social norms, or conventions; and also via natural ones like physical laws of thermodynamics, or electromagnetism. In this design process, the value or worth of any particular set of guiding structures, is acknowledged as being culturally dependent, and also as being contextually *bounded* to "the end-user" of the built interface. 

1. For engineering purposes, the meaning of the word [end-user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) is often the same as the technical, and legally warranted usage of the concept of end-user in contractual agreements called, "End-user License Agreement (EULA)" for goods or services supplied by an agency, to a consenting consumer.  

1. Examples on how to build an Abstraction Hierarchy, when conducting a Work Domain Analysis, are explained within this article on Ecological Interface Design: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_interface_design  

1. Some more details about how Ecological Interface Design plays an integral role in industrial, and systems engineering, is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_interface_design

#### 4. Military work

Activities carried out by regimented armed forces personnel and staff, which can be legally considered as being: morally and ethically earnest, and legitimate. 

An appropriate and internationally codified definition of military work is required for answering questions like, 

1. How are projection of military power and use of force, different from extortion or armed robbery; especially, when they are used for subduing a country into submissively accepting unfair and inequitable trade deals? 

1. Is the ultimate purpose of military work only to annex territories and enslave other nations as client states, and to then use captured peoples as guinea pigs for every type of experimentation? 

</br>

#### 5. Accessible domains of military work and the cybernetic domain

The different types of physical domains, where a military unit can carry out a set of actions that constitute human labor, are typically defined as land, sea, air, and outer space. 

The concept of "cybernetic domain" for carrying out actions that constitute human labor, was defined as a doctrine via the framework of Work Domain Analysis, as the overall physical ensemble, of all regions of land, sea, air and outer space, where human communication via any type of signaling is feasible. 

<details><summary>More details:</summary>

For the military, the cyber-domain (i.e. the cybernetic domain) isn't merely the aspect of day-to-day reality that involves electronic communications, it is the whole of reality across every measurable span of space and time, that involves any communicability of physical information, between any and all communicating entities including engineered devices, and human beings. 

Without such a definition of the cyber-domain, the concepts of cyber-warfare, and cyber-attacks cannot be defined. And with such a definition of the cyber-domain, cyber-warfare has come to include genetic modification, social engineering, computer networking, and multimedia based attacks on supervised as well as unsupervised systems. 

So, defending critical infrastructure systems from cyber-attacks, naturally requires an astute comprehension of how those rapid or pernicious attacks can be developed, and orchestrated. 

As such, through this framework of definitions, the military subsumes all human activities, and asserts superior authority over all categories and classes of actions, that can be performed by any conceivable agency or organization, including the judiciary. It is however, unnecessary for any military unit to be visibly involved in steering a civilian agency or a group.
