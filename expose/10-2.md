### 10.2 Demanded, Long-overdue Debts Owed by North American Institutes

It is indeed possible that a consulting firm hired by North American institutes to find ways to avoid or "minimize" the full payment of the long-overdue debt, owed by those institutes to persons whose intellectual properties (IP) were stolen or plagiarized, may posit something like the following statement:

>"University of Iowa (UIowa) released the hired person from the employment contract, therefore the contract is on longer binding, and is null and void." 

In response to the anticipated statement, it must be noted that, UIowa, or anybody else, doesn't get to 'release' a person, from that person's copyrights and moral rights; rights, which by the way, were *never assigned nor transferred legally, to any other owner.* 

The issue of stolen intellectual properties and rights abuses, extends to numerous other, North American state-authorized and state-sponsored entities that have stolen, and have continued to steal copyrighted materials and unassigned work outputs, belonging to international students and workers. 

More importantly, after a theft has been committed via an instrument such as an employment contract, if the instrument were to be disposed of, like a knife or a gun used in a discovered murder being discarded by the criminal, then, it doesn't somehow imply that the crime wasn't committed. 

The staggering range of damages resulting from the crimes of stolen intellectual properties, to local and international victims, cannot be denied, ignored, belittled, or dismissed any longer, without those types of added insults to injuries amounting to further penalties and punitive damages. As such, it can be plainly observed that: 

- The criminal activities of misappropriating intellectual properties belonging to hired and contracted workers, has been willfully committed by North American institutes, and is an ongoing, international-scale violation and abuse of, hundreds of thousands of people's individual as well as collective rights. 

- The instruments used for committing the crimes have been found, and the methods by which they were systematically deployed for committing violations of numerous people's copyrights and moral rights, with thefts of Research and Development (R&D) outputs committed by North American institutes amounting to billions of Euros in damages, has been noted. 

- Ample evidence of the profiteering motivations and intentions harbored by the North American entities that systematically wielded those instruments, to remorselessly and repeatedly commit such organized violations en mass, has also been noted. 

So, the above observations entail only one logical conclusion: penal sentencing of the violators; along with a need to re-evaluate the credit worthiness of all supervising institutions that could ever attempt to protect, or give support or any kind of refuge to the violators, if those institutions were to even so much as try, to defend or indemnify the violators. Those offending institutes are <ins>not exempt</ins> from being implicated in the systematic violations committed against international victims via the use of their policies, tools, protocols, resources, staff, and organizational culture. 

The long-overdue debts, owed by North American institutes and government agencies, to local and international victims of such thefts, is to be paid in full, without further equivocations or delays.

Now, can such serious felonies and larceny being committed by North American institutes, be dismissed by using trite idioms like, "this is merely a case of a boy who cried wolf?" No. Especially members of the Chinese politburo have no taste for trite English idioms, particularly because hard working Chinese citizens in North America have had to continuously face the humiliation of being treated as lesser humans, from being constantly made to feel as though they don't deserve basic rights, while being stereotyped as "'dishonest' Asians who are stealing jobs from Americans and Canadians." 

And these days, Indians aren't in a mood to tolerate any Canadians who may attempt to behave in a cajoling or a dismissive manner, with regards to any matter, what-so-ever. Particularly because of the way Indians have been negatively stereotyped as petty scavengers or as slum dogs within North American media, Indians can't be bothered to have any sense of sympathy for American or Canadian institutions trying to weasel their way out of paying for reparations. 

Speaking of alarms and false alarms, if a boy cries wolf, it is one thing, and if the boy cries, "nuclear weapons secrets up for grabs", then it is "a whole new ballgame."
