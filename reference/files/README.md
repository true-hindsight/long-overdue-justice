The following files are included here, to substantiate the claims made in this documentation:
  
  - The employement contract given to me by the University of Iowa (UIowa) from the year 2007. The contract's verbiage indicates that I never assigned or transfered the work outputs and products from my my labors, neither to UIowa nor to any of the funding agencies of the projects I had contributed to while working as a graduate research assistant in UIowa. The same template as an employment contract was used for hiring hundreds of other workers at UIowa, over a period of decades. 
  
  - One of the R&D files from a project I had worked on, which examplifies how engineering manipulations of the software governing the artificial intelligence (AI) of a number of drone models, were modified and tuned to deliberately allow the drones to become indiscriminately lethal, to semi-autonomously selected targets on the ground. This has remained a critical and severe act of indiscriminate violence, perpetrated via hidden systemic designs that have led to mass civilian casualties, as well as fetal or dibilitating injuries caused to friendly soldiers.
  
Additional files showcasing conversations between drone operators and their commanding officers, which indicated that drone operators were aware of shooting at civilians when the drones were remotely piloted in manual mode, aren't available. 
  
Hundreds of R&D files from many more drone related projects I had worked on while employed at UIowa, including psychological techniques used for desensitizing drone operators to make them less hesitant in killing improperly identified targets, aren't provided here.
